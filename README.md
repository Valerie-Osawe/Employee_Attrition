# Employee_Attrition
Employee attrition is defined as the natural process by which employees leave the workforce – for example, through resignation for personal reasons or retirement – and are not immediately replaced.

Some forms of attrition are inevitable, such as when an employee retires or relocates. Attrition, however, can seriously hurt both the financial health and corporate culture of your organization after a certain point.
Any firm must prepare for attrition. A day will come when a worker wishes to quit your business, whether for personal or professional reasons.

In this project, I extracted, cleaned, explored and visualized the dataset from IBM employee attribution. I used the dataset to answer the following questions;

- What are the factors behind employee attrition?
- What is the relationship between Education and Monthly Income?
- What is the effect of age on attrition?
- Is Income the main factor in employee attrition?
- How does work-life balance impact the overall attrition rate?
